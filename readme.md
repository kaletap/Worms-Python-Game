# Welcome to Worms!

## Requirements
This script was tested on Python 3.6.4 with pygame version 1.9.4. It doesn't work with Python 2.

## Running instructions
I assume that you already have Python installed (preferably version >= 3.6).
To install pygame run `pip install pygame`.  To play a game run `python worm.py`.

If you want to run it as a script you may need to change mode of the file with `chmod 777 worm.py.` Then, you can run it with `./worm.py`.
